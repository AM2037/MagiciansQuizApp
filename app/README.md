This is a quiz app created for my Udacity Android Basics NanoDegree-- Project 3. It is based on the SyFy series "The Magicians" based on
the book by Lev Grossman.

In the beginning of the app you are asked to fill out your name. If your keyboard is like mine, you will be passed to the next text form
which is in the middle of the quiz if you press Enter. To avoid this, you may exit your keyboard using the arrows at the bottom of the
screen and then proceed to the first question!

I used google images to populate my app, which you can find the links to below:
